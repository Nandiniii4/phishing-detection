# Phishing Website Detection using Hybrid Machine Learning

A comparative study of traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for phishing URL detection, featuring a Hybrid Ensemble Model that combines feature-based XGBoost predictions with a sequence-based 1D-CNN.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates multiple approaches for phishing URL classification:

- **Traditional ML Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Deep Learning:** 1D-CNN trained directly on raw URL strings  
- **Hybrid Ensemble:** Combines XGBoost + CNN outputs for improved performance  

The goal is to benchmark these techniques and identify the most effective detection strategy.
